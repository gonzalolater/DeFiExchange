## Conclusion:

Well, after receiving your code, I was even recently testing and reading all the functionalities of this decentralized exchange.
I was able to reach these conclusions:
* Dependency Conflict.

* These dependencies are outdated and are no longer used for security reasons.

# The solution to all the problems that this DeFi Exchange has is to migrate the entire program to node 20 and update all the packages that are deprecated, even those that have not received support since 2019.

* Migrating to Node.js 20 and updating all deprecated packages may be a solution to resolve some of the issues you are experiencing on your DeFi Exchange. However, it is important to note that performing these updates can require significant time and effort, as there may be incompatibilities and API changes between old and new versions of Node.js and packages.

* Before performing the migration and update, it is advisable to perform a thorough analysis of the packages and dependencies used in your project. This involves checking if newer versions are available for packages that are deprecated and evaluating the implications of updating them.

# Some aspects that you should consider before performing the migration and update are:

* Compatibility: Make sure all dependencies and packages you use are compatible with Node.js 20 and the latest versions of the packages you plan to update. Some packages may have specific Node.js version requirements.
Extensive testing: Perform extensive testing after migration and upgrade to ensure that no new bugs or compatibility issues have been introduced. Automated and manual testing are important to ensure proper functioning of the program.

* Documentation: Update your DeFi Exchange documentation to reflect the changes made in the migration and upgrade. This will help developers and users understand the requirements and changes in the system.

* Support and maintenance: Keep in mind that when updating packages, you will also need to make sure to keep them updated in the future. This means staying on top of security updates and patches to avoid future problems.

* In summary, migrating to Node.js 20 and updating deprecated packages can be a valid solution, but it is important to perform a thorough assessment of the associated impacts and risks. Remember to make backups and updates gradually, testing and verifying system stability at each step. It is always advisable to have the support of an experienced development team during the migration and upgrade process. They will be able to help you address any issues or challenges that arise during the process.

Also, keep in mind that updating packages may require changes to your existing code. Some APIs or functionality may have changed between the old and new versions of the packages. Therefore, you may need to update and adjust your code to be compatible with updated versions.

Before you begin the migration and upgrade, make sure you have a solid backup plan in case you encounter unexpected problems or need to revert to the previous configuration.

In general, migrating to a newer version of Node.js and keeping your packages up to date is a good practice to ensure the stability, security, and compatibility of your application. However, it is important to carefully evaluate the risks and consider the impact on your project before making any significant changes.

## Test task: Add blockchain api to display the eth, bnb current price on wallet profile page.

I can do this, but it would have to have more than 70% of the Exchange functionalities. Keep in mind that creating an ApiKey on the Blockchain with CoinGecko would take me a maximum of 20 minutes, but I would not be doing the job correctly since it would be lying to you about how the program works.

# Audit time: 8 hours.
